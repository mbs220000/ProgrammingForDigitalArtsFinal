## Description
This is the classic snake game where the snake creature must use the arrow keys to travel the screen to collect fruit and grow. By eating fruit the player's snake will grow in size and the game score will increase with each fruit. As the character grows the game becomes harder to manage and they must be careful because if the character hits a wall or themselves the game will end. When the character collides with themself or a wall the player's final score will appear and after a few seconds the game screen will close.
