# Snake Game

## Repository

## Description
Inspired by the clasic 'Snake' game where a snake slithers the board using WASD tp collect fruit/ items to grow I will create something similar. By Creating something inspired by an existing game it allows me to focus on programming and mechanics rather than story looks.

## Features
- Feature 1
	- Movement Through WASD could be a set of if and elif statments.
- Feature 2
	- Collections could be if statments that del if ran into.
- Feature 3 
	- Another If statment could be used whn running into walls or barriers to end the game.

## Challenges
- I will need to figure out how to program the snake 'growing' each time he gets a fruit.
- Possibly adding colliders or barriers to make the game harder as more items are collected.
- Short sentence of any skill or topic that needs to be learnt or researched.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- I will recreate the original game or use the base mechanics to create a new character/ world with item collections and a 'growing' mechanic

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- I am able to get a character to move around the screen that collects items

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Basic art for the character and Game
  2. Basic code/ movements

- Week 2
  1. Item can be picked up
  2. Adding my art/ style to game

- Week N (Final)
  1. Adding colliders/ barriers at later levels
  2. Making the character grow
