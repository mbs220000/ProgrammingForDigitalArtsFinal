## Repository

## Description
Inspired by the clasic 'Snake' game where a snake slithers the board using WASD tp collect fruit/ items to grow I will create something similar 

## Features
- Feature 1
	- Short explaination of how it will be executed.
- Feature 2
	- Short explaination of how it will be executed.
- Feature N 
	- Short explaination of how it will be executed.

## Challenges
- I will need to figure out how to program the snake 'growing' each time he gets a fruit.
- Possibly adding colliders or barriers to make the game harder as more items are collected.
- Short sentence of any skill or topic that needs to be learnt or researched.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- I will recreate the original game or use the base mechanics to create a new character/ world with item collections and a 'growing' mechanic

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- I am able to get a character to move around the screen that collects items
